 #Online Election Management System – Project Description
The Online Election Management System is a modern web application built with Laravel and Bootstrap, designed to facilitate the creation, management, and participation in elections digitally. The platform offers a secure and user-friendly interface for admins to manage elections, candidates, and users, while also allowing authenticated users to cast their votes.

#🔧 Key Features
👩‍💼 Admin/Moderator Functionality:
Election Creation: Admins can create elections with details like title, description, start and end date.

Candidate Management: Easily add, edit, or remove candidates associated with specific elections. Includes image upload and detailed bios.

Profile Management: Collect detailed personal information from users such as NID number, profession, education, and addresses.

Vote Monitoring: Track how many votes each candidate receives in real time.

#👥 User Functionality:
Registration & Authentication: Secure registration with email and password confirmation. Laravel's middleware ensures protected routes.

Voting System: Once authenticated, users can vote only once per election, with restrictions to prevent revoting for stability.

Profile Submission: Users can submit a detailed profile to qualify for certain elections or roles.

#🎨 User Interface:
Built with Bootstrap 5 for a responsive and clean design.

Modern UI for displaying elections, candidates, and voting options using Bootstrap cards and grid layouts.

Real-time feedback with alert messages, animations (like blinking warning before voting), and responsive forms.

#🔐 Security & Validation:
Laravel’s form validation is used throughout to prevent invalid inputs.

File uploads are validated for type and size.

User input is sanitized and relationships (like foreign keys) are strictly enforced using Eloquent ORM.

#📊 Statistics & Reporting (Optional):
Candidate vote counts.

Election status (upcoming, ongoing, ended).

Voter participation summary.
